"""
Instance-wide health snapshots: Celery queue depths, database connection usage and
per-table sizes.

These are collected from the scheduler loop rather than from a Celery task on
purpose. Queue backlog and connection exhaustion are exactly the conditions under
which a worker-based collector stops reporting, so the metric would disappear at
the moment it becomes interesting. The scheduler is a plain loop with no worker
dependency, which makes it the right observer.

Cost notes, since the caller polls this on every cycle:

  * Queue depth is a Redis LLEN, which is O(1).
  * The connection query scans a fixed-size shared-memory array sized to
    max_connections, not a table. Roughly a millisecond.
  * Table sizes are the only non-trivial one. pg_total_relation_size() takes no
    locks and scans nothing, but it does a stat() per 1 GB file segment per fork,
    across each table, its TOAST relation and every index. That is usually tens of
    milliseconds, but can spike on a cold dentry cache or network storage, which is
    why it is sampled on a longer interval.
  * Celery worker stats cost a flat second, because inspect() blocks for its whole
    timeout rather than returning once every worker has replied. Also sampled on a
    longer interval, since pool sizing only changes on deploys and restarts.

The scheduler also trims this table to a fixed retention window as it goes, so the
snapshots stay bounded without depending on a separate cleanup job.
